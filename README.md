# Lisp Recorder
### Simple GUI for fixed time recording of common lisping words in good/bad pronanciation
Written for data collecting for our final project - lisp recognition with machine/deep learning

#### Libraries I used in this project:

- PyAudio
- PySimpleGui

#### Usage:
replace constants with wanted values:

- WORDS - list of word to be recorded
- NUM_RECORDS - number of records for each word and pronanciation
- RECORD_SECONDS - fixed time for each recording

Run script and record:

input name and click start, then press 'record' to start recording for current word, press 'next' for next word (pretty self explainatory, isn't it?)
