# Lisp Recorder
### Simple GUI for fixed time recording of common lisping words in good/bad pronunciation
Written for data collection for our final project - lisp recognition with machine/deep learning

#### Libraries I used in this project:

- PyAudio
- PySimpleGui

#### Usage:
update json for wanted values:

- "words" - list of word to be recorded
- "records" - number of records for each word and pronanciation
- "record_sec" - fixed time for each recording

Run script and record:

Enter name and click start, then press 'record' to start recording for current word, press 'next' for next word (pretty self explainatory, isn't it?).
Can press 'Replay' to hear the last recorded word.
